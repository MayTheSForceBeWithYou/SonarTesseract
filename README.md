# SonarTesseract
Hosted SonarQube server that can ingest repositories and spit out results

Implementation plan to build and package a SonarQube server on Azure that analyzes GitHub repositories and provides scan results, deployable by others.

**1. Architecture Design:**

*   **Azure Compute:** Choose a Virtual Machine (VM) for hosting SonarQube.  Consider a size appropriate for your expected workload.  A Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) is recommended for SonarQube.
*   **Database:** SonarQube requires a database.  PostgreSQL is a popular and recommended choice. You can use Azure Database for PostgreSQL (flexible server or single server) for managed PostgreSQL.  This simplifies management.
*   **SonarQube Server:** Install SonarQube on the VM.
*   **SonarQube Scanner:** The scanner will run *outside* the SonarQube server (typically on a separate build agent or within a CI/CD pipeline). It's responsible for analyzing the code and sending the results to the SonarQube server.
*   **GitHub Integration:** Configure SonarQube to integrate with GitHub. This usually involves setting up an application in GitHub and providing the necessary credentials to SonarQube.  This allows SonarQube to access the repository for analysis.
*   **Web Interface:** SonarQube provides a web interface for viewing scan results.
*   **CI/CD (Optional but Recommended):**  A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) can automate the process of checking out code from GitHub, running the SonarQube scanner, and sending the results to the SonarQube server.

**2. Implementation Steps:**

*   **Set up Azure Resources:**
    *   Create a Resource Group to contain all your resources.
    *   Create a Virtual Machine (Linux recommended).
    *   Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server (flexible server or single server). Make sure the VM can access the database (networking configuration).
*   **Install and Configure SonarQube (on the VM):**
    *   SSH into the VM.
    *   Install Java (required by SonarQube).
    *   Download and install SonarQube.
    *   Configure SonarQube to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   Start the SonarQube server.
*   **GitHub Integration:**
    *   Create an OAuth application in your GitHub organization or account.
    *   Configure SonarQube with the GitHub application credentials.
*   **SonarQube Scanner Setup (Separate from the Server):**
    *   You'll need a machine (VM, build agent, or container) where the SonarQube scanner will run.
    *   Install the SonarQube scanner on this machine.
    *   Create a script or use a CI/CD pipeline to:
        *   Check out the code from the GitHub repository.
        *   Run the SonarQube scanner, providing the GitHub repository URL, SonarQube server URL, and authentication token.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Create a test GitHub repository.
    *   Run the scanner against the test repository.
    *   Verify that the results are displayed in the SonarQube web interface.

**3. Packaging and Deployment:**

*   **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates or Bicep:** The best way to package this for others to deploy is to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  Create an ARM template or use Bicep to define all the Azure resources (VM, database, network settings, etc.).  This template will allow users to deploy the entire environment with a single click or command.
*   **Packer (Optional but Recommended for VM Image):** If you want to provide a pre-configured VM image with SonarQube already installed, use Packer. Packer can create images for Azure (and other platforms) that include your software and configurations.  This makes the deployment process much faster.
*   **Deployment Process:**
    *   Provide the ARM template or Bicep file along with clear instructions.
    *   Users will deploy the template to their Azure subscription.  They'll need to provide some parameters (e.g., VM size, database credentials, GitHub application ID and secret).
    *   After deployment, they can access the SonarQube server and configure projects to analyze their GitHub repositories.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Secure the SonarQube server and database. Use strong passwords, configure network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access, and consider using Azure Key Vault to store sensitive information.
*   **Scalability:** Design your architecture to scale.  If you expect a large number of projects or frequent scans, you might need to increase the size of the VM and database.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Choose VM and database sizes that are appropriate for your needs. Monitor resource usage and adjust as needed.
*   **CI/CD Integration:**  Integrate SonarQube with your CI/CD pipeline for automated code analysis.
*   **Documentation:**  Provide clear documentation on how to deploy and use your SonarQube server.

**Example ARM Template Snippet (Simplified - VM and Database):**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "vmName": { "type": "string" },
    "adminUsername": { "type": "string" },
    "adminPassword": { "type": "securestring" },
    "dbServerName": { "type": "string" },
    "dbAdminUser": { "type": "string" },
    "dbAdminPassword": { "type": "securestring" }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
      "name": "[parameters('vmName')]",
      // ... VM configuration ...
    },
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers",
      "name": "[parameters('dbServerName')]",
      // ... PostgreSQL configuration ...
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a high-level overview.  Each step involves detailed configuration.  Remember to consult the official SonarQube and Azure documentation for specific instructions.  Using IaC (ARM templates or Bicep) is crucial for making your solution easily deployable by others.
